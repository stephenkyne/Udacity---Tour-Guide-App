Android Basics Nanodegree project: Tour Guide App
### About The Project ###
The Tour Guide App displays lists of venues in Greenwich London, UK. There are two Activites, the MainActivity and the DetailsActivity. The MainActivity displays four Fragments that containt the lists of venues. The venues are divided into four areas, "Museum", "Food", "Drink" and "Hotel". On the Fragment, a list item is made up of a image of the Venue and it's name. When a list item is clicked the venues details are obtained and sent to the DetailsActivity. There the following venue details are displayed;
- Image of venue
- Name
- Address 
- About, a short descriptions of the venue.

There are icons that open Intents, they are;
- Telephone number, opens the call app
- Share, gives a user the name and address of the venue to share.

- Directions, opens google maps and gets directions to the venue.
